# Hi
This is my custom C++ engine code. It is the foundation of all my other game projects. The ThirdParty folder contains codes from third-party libraries, like https://github.com/ocornut/imgui, https://github.com/nothings/stb, https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2, and Noise code from SMU Guildhall Professor Squirrel Eiserloh.
